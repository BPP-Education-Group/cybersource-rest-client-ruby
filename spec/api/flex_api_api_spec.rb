  # unit tests for generate_flex_api_capture_context
  # Establish a Payment Session with a Capture Context
  # To establish a payment session, include the API fields you plan to use in that session in the body of the request.  The system then returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that includes the capture context.   To determine which fields to include in your capture context, identify the personal information that you wish to isolate from the payment session.  **Capture Context Fields**&lt;br&gt; When making a session request, any fields that you request to be added to the capture context are required by default.  However, you can choose to make a field optional by setting the required parameter to false. 
  # @param generate_flex_api_capture_context_request 
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @return [String]
