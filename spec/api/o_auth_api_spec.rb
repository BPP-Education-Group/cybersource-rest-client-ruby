  # unit tests for create_access_token
  # Create access token and refresh token
  # This request is used by technology partners to obtain an access token and a refresh token, which are contained in the response.  The partner can then use the access token for authentication when submitting API requests to CyberSource on behalf of the merchant.   The request must include the authorization code that was included in the URL redirect response from CyberSource (see [full documentation](https://developer.cybersource.com/api/developer-guides/OAuth/cybs_extend_intro.html)). Access tokens expire after 15 minutes. The refresh token is used to create a new access token, it expires after one year.
